this all should be done when the user clicks that they want to send an email 
( ) grab each of the checkboxes (with them store in an array if you want)
( ) see if each of those checkboxes has been checked (...getElementeById element.checked)
( ) if one has been checked, store that it's been checked somewhere (as a var (array?))
( ) then compose your email string
